# Homework 4: Examining Fight Song Lyrics - Shiny App
# Before you begin, make sure you read and understand the assignment description
# on canvas first! This assignment will not make sense otherwise. 
# For each question/prompt, write the necessary code to create your shiny app. 
# Make sure you have written AND TESTED all of your code in analysis.R before 
# beginning this part of the assignment.

# Creating your UI -------------------------------------------------------------

# Part of this UI is created for you. You need to add elements to make your UI
# match the example provided in the instruction.

    # 1) drop down menu that lets the user select a particular college from the 
    #    dataset. The inputId should be `school_name` and the prompt should be 
    #    "Choose a School"
    # 2) Three html outputs that we will use to contain the information about the
    #   lyrics for that particular school. Use the following 4 lines of code to 
    #   add these elements: 
    #htmlOutput(outputId = "song_name"),
    #htmlOutput(outputId = "composer"),
    #htmlOutput(outputId = "lyrics"),
